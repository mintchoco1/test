/*					HW3 (5pts, Due: 11/24 23:59)
Your goal is
1) to complete the class Shape, and
2) to create two classes, Circle and Square, by inheriting from the class Shape,
to make the main function work properly.

Notes.
1. You are NOT ALLOWED to modify the main function.
2. The class Shape is currently incomplete; something must be added or modified.
   You are FREE to modify the class Shape.


The key requirements are listed below:
1. Both Circle and Square are characterized by one integer variable _d which has a different meaning as follows:
	 In Circle, a _d represents the radius of a circle.
	 In Square, a _d represents the length of one side. (Recall: In a square, all four sides are the same length.)

2. displayTypeAndArea()
	This function displays the type (either circle or square) and the area of the caller object.
	It may give different results depending on which object is calling it.
	For example, if displayTypeAndArea() is called by a square with _d of 2, then its ouput will be something like "Type: Square, Area: 4".
	And, "Type: Circle, Area: 3.14", if called by a circle with _d of 1.

3. The static variable cnt is employed to keep track of the number of objects.

4. Destructors
	You need to implement destructors for both the base and derived classes (3 in total).
	Recall that the destructor of a derived class and the destructor of the base class must be called in order, everytime an object is destroyed. Otherwise, a memory leak might occur.
	Plus, make each destructor show some message such as "[Circle] Destructor Called", so you can see which class is calling it.
